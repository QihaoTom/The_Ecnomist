## The US and China: drifting apart(分离)
*The US-China trade dispute* is set to worsen in the coming months. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects both sides to enact a second round of tariff increases that will affect a total of around US 80bn in *bilateral trade*. However, a threatened third round of tariffs is less likely to be introduced. This means that the dispute will stop short of ***mutating into***(change into) an *outright*(direct and clear) "trade war" that would have damaging, spillover effects for the global economy. Nevertheless, bilateral economic tensions will *persist*, and will increasingly shift to non-tariff barriers. The *outlook* for the relationship in the coming years is *poor*.

The US-China trade relationship, which began to *deteriorate* following the collapse of *the bilateral Comprehensive Economic Dialogue* in mid-2017, has worsened in 2018. In March, in the first round of *tit-for-tat tariff actions*, the US imposed higher tariffs on *steel and aluminium imports*, potentially affecting around US 3bn-worth of metals from China. *In response*, China **targeted** around US 2.5bn-worth of *US agricultural products*. This first round was minor, bearing in mind that bilateral trade was worth almost US$600bn in 2017. Accordingly, there has been little *discernible*(perceived clearly) economic impact to date, even if global equity markets have become **jittery**(nervous) at the prospect of further measures. The value of bilateral trade continued to *grow robustly* in the first quarter of 2018, with Chinese exports to the US up by almost 15% year on year in value terms, and Chinese imports from the US rising by nearly 9%.

### Tit-for-tat

A second round of tariffs has the potential to be more harmful. In late March *the US Trade Representative (USTR)*, which has led an investigation into Chinese intellectual property protection and technology transfer practices (the so-called *Section 301 investigation*) announced that it would propose *ad-valorem*(从价税) tariffs of 25% on more than 1,300 Chinese imports, *targeting sectors linked to the "Made in China 2025" industrial policy*. These imports had a value of around US 46bn in 2017. The USTR has opened the proposed list for public consultation until May 11th, with subsequent hearings and **rebuttals**（反驳） scheduled for later that month.

China's Ministry of Commerce responded to the USTR list with its own proposals to raise tariffs by 25% across 106 categories of US imports, targeting mainly transport and agricultural goods with a similar combined value. Items on the list with significant exposure to the Chinese market include aeroplanes, soybeans and motor vehicles. For example, China is the largest buyer of US soybeans, accounting for almost two-thirds of exports in 2017. The commerce ministry plans to **retaliate**（revenge） as soon as US tariffs are implemented.

### Into battle

We expect the second round of tariffs to be **imposed** by both sides almost in their *entirety*, although *bilateral negotiations and business lobbying* will result in some goods being **struck from** the lists. The recent commitment by China's president, Xi Jinping, to reduce tariffs on vehicle imports could result in that category of goods being omitted from the USTR list. But major concessions **are unlikely**. The US president, Donald Trump, will not step back given *his long-held fixation* with the US trade deficit and China more **broadly**. US-China co-operation on North Korea helped to **ward off**(prevent) trade tensions in 2017, but with Mr Trump scheduled to meet the North Korean leader, *Kim Jong-un*, in May the US administration now has less need of Chinese assistance. Meanwhile, Mr Xi does not want to be perceived as yielding to US pressure, with Chinese officials *stressing that the proposal to cut automotive import tariffs was not a response to American trade threats*. China has also refused to reduce support for Made in China 2025, which is **integral(intact) to** domestic economic planning.

Given these **imperatives**, we expect tariffs on goods worth around US 40bn to be imposed by each side. Importantly, we do not expect a third round of tariffs, despite Mr Trump's threats on Twitter for tariffs covering a further US 100bn in Chinese imports. There are reasons to be **sceptical about**(doubt) *this rhetoric*. *International pressure* on the US administration over its trade policies will grow, while the administration *may struggle to justify tariffs* on Chinese products with less tangible links to Made in China 2025. Both sides will become more **cognisant to** the risks of escalation once the economic impact of the first two rounds of tariffs become clear. Mr Trump may be sensitive to the impact on agricultural states—which constitute his *domestic power base—ahead of US mid-term elections in November 2018*. Nevertheless, Mr Trump's unpredictability means that there is a significant risk attached to this relatively **benign forecast**.

### Higher prices, steady growth

*Under our core scenario*, around 15% of two-way trade will be covered once tariffs are introduced on US 80bn-worth of goods. This is not a sufficiently big number to affect economic growth. For the US, exports to China were worth around US 130bn in 2017, or a little over 8% of total exports. The US is not an especially *trade-intensive economy—total trade in goods and services combined stood at only 27% of GDP in 2017*—which means that a worst-case-scenario loss of US 40bn in trade to China *would not be visible in headline economic statistics*. For China, the US absorbed almost 20% of goods exports in 2017. Substitute markets for some products could be found, although China might be **wary about**(careful about) *prompting anti-dumping actions* in regions such as the EU. Again, *a worst-case scenario* of losing all US 40bn would not be visible in data on the overall rate of economic growth.

In both the US and China, tariffs are likely to exert a stronger effect on price levels than growth. According to the *Peterson Institute of International Economics*, fully 85% of the products selected by the US for import tariffs are parts or components of some description. Were these tariffs to be applied to finished products from China, such as mobile phones or **garments**(clothes), American consumers and businesses would have the option of buying a different, cheaper product instead. But these tariffs will be applied to components produced by American companies. This means that **a swathe of** US companies will have to choose between cutting their profit margin to maintain market share or increasing their prices. We have raised our forecast for consumer price inflation in the US in 2018‑19 by 0.1 of a percentage point in each year to account for some firms passing higher manufacturing costs onto consumers. We do not expect the US Federal Reserve to *alter its course for interest rates* as a result of slightly stronger inflation.

Import tariffs will also *lead to higher consumer prices in China*. The main consideration is how a 25% tariff increase on US soybean imports could stimulate consumer prices, given their role in the domestic livestock supply chain. Almost 90% of the soybeans consumed by China in 2017 were imported, with the US being the second-largest source, behind Brazil. Soybeans are *a major foodstuff for pigs especially*: food **comprises around** 30.5% of the consumer price index basket, based on unofficial estimates, with pork likely to represent 5‑10% by itself.

However, various factors are likely to work against **a spike(increase) in inflation**. China could look to other suppliers for imports, such as Brazil and Russia; Chinese agriculture firms are increasingly active in the latter country. It could turn to substitutes, *such as rapeseed, cottonseed, corn and distillers dried grains*. It also has the option to tap its own *strategic reserves of soybeans*. Such policy options would be sufficient to **keep a lid on inflation**, with price growth unlikely to **surpass the 3% ceiling set** by the People's Bank of China (the central bank) for **a prolonged period**(continue for a long time).

### First trade, then security

Even under our *relatively benign central forecast*, the bilateral relationship will *remain characterised by trade tensions*. Although we expect no further rounds of tariffs to be enacted, negotiations will **shift to non-tariff barriers**. Mr Trump has already asked the US Treasury to draft a list of US sectors that could impose restrictions on Chinese investment such as *joint-venture requirements*. Although US business groups are divided on tariffs, there is broader agreement on introducing investment restrictions to mirror those facing US companies in China. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which **screens foreign mergers and acquisitions**, is also likely to **tighten approval processes** for Chinese companies. We would expect China to respond in kind. It already **exerts pressure on US companies** through licensing approvals, security reviews and anti-monopoly investigations. More **probes(investigation) into major US firms** could be started, and consumer-led boycotts of US products cannot be **ruled out**(eliminate). *More broadly*, the Chinese government *may be less willing to engage in the type of liberal economic reforms that the US administration would like to see*.

Although our forecast suggests that **the current preoccupation(all attention) with tariffs** will be limited, *our medium-term outlook* for the relationship is poor. **A steady detachment**(withdrawl) in trade and investment ties will **exacerbate(加剧) differences** over security issues, including the South China Sea, Taiwan and North Korea. The **Trump administration has already described China as a "revisionist power"**, *bracketing it with Russia*, and expressed concern about *China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative*. **Therefore, even if this current episode passes without major economic instability, fresh challenges in US-China relations are just around the corner**.
